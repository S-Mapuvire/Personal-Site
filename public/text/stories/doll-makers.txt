it was always kinda odd 
									this part of the job 

		sitting 
							waiting
			watching 

			
				a bathtub 
		
		all alone 						in this dingy room
			
				a robin's egg 
					half-melted
					split open
					lit bright 
						like on display 
							
							in this 
						steel decay
						spray of grey
								and brown
	inside?
				liquid 
					not water
						too wavy
						too chunky
						too shiny

	it's...'company goo'...
		the...goo...sat still...

					with an arm stuck out
						tough as hurt feelings
							stiff as a old jokes 
			a tad bit lower
		it would almost appear					
				relaxed
					like a pampered spa goer
		instead?
				no head
				no shoulders
				all gone
					
						submerged
				
					but it's okay
						it's
							not exactly human
							they'd laugh at her if she said that
			raised carapace
				erased texture
		 dead giveaways

but, 
still
		some-one/thing was buried there
							...does goo 'bury'...?
			like a bathplug with ears

it always felt weird
			humanoid, dogdroid 
						any other kind of simulacra
				it felt 
				wrong 
					to her
					to just sit there as...it's bathing?
						where the air cannot reach
						where the eye cannot see
they're supposed to remove the parts
	clean them individually
		but she found this worked just as well
			well, twice as half almost, 
				so why not?
watching used to be...
	hellish?
	guilt-inducing?
	heart-activating?
	exciting?
										...fun?
	uh, no no no no
			
			but now, it was just a job, 
		with fizzes and spritzes of feelings

even in regards to this part
there was plenty more to the job
there was fun

she checked her wrist
	1 minute left, her fLoW displayed
she waved over it again,
	11:39 pm
she squinted,
	another whole day gone
she sighed, 
	whatever, least the fun can start now

she flicked her wrist
palid white filled her view
a square, popped out

		"Day Zero Exploit Found in Altru Software"
			...eye roll...
				again?
							good ol' "Day Zero Altru"
she had a theory 
	Altru made secret backdoors for some part of the government
							but poorly, every time
							and they got leaked, every time
	but who knows?
		all she knew was when they mess up 
			'they' as in other defence specialists in other companies

		then they all had pressure on them
	'they' and 'them' as in herself
			well
				just her, really
				this is mostly about her

		and were seen as sloppy, 
			untrustworthy, incompetent
			foolish

light clatters
	plates
	scuffing chairs
he dangled the cable
	thicker than 10 rat tails
		put together

"...less than 8K is trash."
