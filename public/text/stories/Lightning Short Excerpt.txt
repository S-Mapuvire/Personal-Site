ÅgIs that a problem?Åh Pers huffed, slumping back, ÅgWe were never going to find anything. It was practically guaranteed, we were sent just to ease the nervousness of an embezzler.Åh

ÅgOur client spent a ridiculous amount of money on this inquiry to cover the extra-ridiculous amount of money that they took for...who-knows-what?Åh

ÅgThose are rumors.Åh

ÅgOr leaked information.Åh

The manager leaned back, taking a sip of red divine, and closing her eyes, keeping silent for a minute.Åh

ÅgVani.Åh She began.

ÅgErrr, yes maÅfam?Åh

ÅgWhat do you think we should tell the client?Åh

ÅgÅfcuse me?Åh

ÅgWeÅfve been at this for a while now, thereÅfs nothing here, but we can keeping looking.Åh

Pers jumped in, ÅgMuch as sheÅfs loathe to admit it, weÅfre all just using each other here. The clientÅfs giving us cash and weÅfre giving them an alibi to their expenses. And we can just keep going long as we want.Åh

Hyperreals

Around each natural number ? is a halo of hyperreals ? infinitesimals surrounding any given integer ? with infinites (negative and positive) surrounding it as well from far

Extends the standard - beyond the ordinary

Paradoxes of infinity ? bounded boundlessness

Disappearing quantities ? tiny pieces off the whole

?????????????????????????????????????????

Key Metaphors

Physical tech ? something to hold against the light, 
Colour ? divine and created, 
Exploration and travel ? movement, latitudes and perspectives, 
Light ? flow, 
Finite infinites 

?????????????????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????????

Setting

City where usage of light in scientific, and other places, is seen as essential and desirous and central to all 

An order with lightning-mancer performers who use electricity to entertain and use it in flashy performances and not to harm

The former jewel of the ex-empire (long ago), relics and artifacts and antiquities hoarded ? even the statue, supposedly 
An almost-independent almost-city state with self-appointed importance

City govt is trying to establish a sense of patriotism, creating tradition and downplaying pre-existing religious, economic, socio-political, and intellectual divisions, and relying on trying to create an Åeopen community for allÅf

Location

nicknames for city? official titles? dialectised names?

who rules the city? esp since it aims for imp ambitions? 

what do folks dress like?

Street vendors, 
domed buildings, 
buildings alone on quadrangle, 
colorful houses with everything painted - even if raggedly, 
hanging flags from outside walls of public establishments, 
overhanging store roofs that almost touch, 
excessively spacious backstreets
colourful buildings, 
back and forth patchwork developments

inventing traditions ? Ågand this is our beloved flag! we shall see it everywhere!Åh, creating purposefully ancient-looking monuments

BUT I DONT WANT IT TO BE JUST OTTOMAN ISTANBUL WITH MAGIC - what is the intention? what is wanted from the city? from its representation?
find examples of synthesised societies

=> city is a merchant hub with a penchant for attracting wealth from other regions,
has gained imperialistic ambitions of expanding into surrounding areas in influence, aims to use its wealth to control further areas, 
(venice, switzerland, netherlands? find chinese, african, arabic merchant hubs?)
religious history with accessiblility built into the culture (south american cultures?), 
cool and hot - located in a valley it avoids a lot of the colder weather but accumulates heat in summer,
is building a culture (new italian republic?),
tri-government (venetian styled),

colour obsessed - statue incident caused a religious association with colours that are applied to everything often with haphazard colouring, colours are painted on

Cafes are big in turkey/arabic region - what kinds of coffeeshops are there?
Calligraphic designs are also big - words as visual design - poetry
Ottomans had ornate structures in core, but less ornate stuff in their subjugated periphery - balkans, syria, 
(maybe this world too has peripheries of the city? perhaps that is the cage?)
Imperial groups gain as spoils the past of their subjugated, and physical remains are part of the past, so...

Beliefs

*learn basic turkish and arabic to come up with names for colour and light* 
playful meet - liqa' murah OR ?akac? bulu?ma (?ak??ma?)

Brilliant-Neon ? scientific term at the time for plasma and arcing electricity alike

Adjuster's Light ? proposed phenomenon that everything is capable of producing light

Travel lamp ? consisting of a glass, double-layered vessel with a sponge in the innermost layer where a fluid for burning is poured. Part of the initial heat from the burning of the wick, inserted in the sponge, would be redirected to the air in-between the layers so as to allow the fluid to heat up and more easily vapourise without being held so closely to the sponge

Colour = magic = science

Colour is religiously linked too, so they are capitalised as is any noun after it, e.g. Red-Steam

Colour is proposed to be resultant of 'true light' interacting with aether in differing ways - change the light source and colours change, then they exist in that hue - aether is infinitely thin but absolute in depth, filling everything

Characters

**make characters less of stereotypes - i.e. the young, ignorant, wide-eyed assistant and the aloof older disappointment
**find different term than 'light mystics'

Vani ? perspective character, slight build, enby, short black messy hair, skin like dusted espresso, yellow eyes, assistant, enthralled by everything, initially eager, new to this area, originally lived in a colonised land where movement and knowledge were limited and hoped to learn more about light mystics upon entering city and becoming Pers' protege but has since become jaded as the pair works basically as fake detectives - carving out a living from pretend work, constantly pessimistic on city's motives and suspicious of the new system they, and the wealthiest denizens, are trying to create, religious but culturally so, 
also works in the artifact recollection department - leads to finding fragments or something?

Pers ? tall, long ruffled hair, regularly switching between condescending and extremely unconfident, issues with alcohol, wears bias on sleeve, knowledgeable about light mystics but disinterested in doing any recently (plateaued in information and feels stuck and confused **maybe keep this aspect**), almost secretive but more so disinterested in engaging with truthes, appreciates where the city could be going but inherently distrusts power exerted from large organisations
strong 'was cool in the 80s'/'it was acceptable in the 90s' type energy

Innkeeper ? inn manager but also information dealer who assigns jobs of her agents of varying legitimacy, forceful and commanding, widely known with a fearsome reputation, drinks a lot but is still functional, constantly busy, doesn't really stand behind anything except getting jobs done

The client - highly ranked in govt, in information council, inelegant in speech and rushes in talking

Narrative

==now==

the two search for pieces of the statue, broken 200 years ago

==crux==

a religious statue smashed with Green Brilliant-Neon (green lightning) from the sky
(slight crossover with religious group that beautifies everything and destroys them?)

precise division encoded into religion - exact steps and rules - OR unimaginably fine division combined with folklore and encoded into culture - rumors and heresay? determinism v randomness?

==rigors==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDQjn_-pDSs

statue broke into: 
(49x + (x + 5y)) pieces - 49 small pieces and one large that split into sets of 5 and a set of whatever gets the set to 7-divisible - 5 steppes making y sets and 49 pieces with one more split into x
a large anti-prime (highly composite number), 
able to be cleanly broken into many numbers - maybe 5040 - makes 720 sets of 7
pieces were imbued with magic, or created as such or something else
cannot find other pieces if too close to one

one large mass impossible to be rejoined, faith unseen when held to closely - nothing 'makes sense' at an excessively micro-scale

popular amongst more powerful, wealthy, 'educated'
basis for faith (and strictness) of newer ideas

????????????????????????????????????????????
? 
? 
? 
explanation of (49x + (x + 5y)), without watching video

number written in decimal form can be expessed as (10x + y), 
this is equivalent with multiplication to (50x + 5y), 
this can be rearranged to (49x + (x + 5y)), 
49x is divisible by 7 
hence if (x + 5y) is divisible by 7 then the whole is as well

trick for seeing divisibility by 7: 5 * end digit + rest of digits

also, 5040 would be 7 [49(14) + (14 + 5 (4))] i.e. 7 sets of 720, 
where 720 is produced from floor division of 720/49 = 14, 
then for remainder => 720 mod 49 = 34, 
x = 14 as shown prior, 
leaving 20 = 5y => 4

==hypers==

or maybe:
they broke into infinitesmal pieces, unable to fit perfectly together, 
the other share taken by the godesses, 
so they say 
the many can never become one again
they sprinkled, raining down coloured mist that inspired the obsession with colour - a godly sign that what laid beyond was wreathed in hues and shades beyond what they could imagine

faith manifested in light and given to all, 
desperately faint and impossibly dispersed into fineness

incorporated into daily beliefs more easily
more idioms


== ==

also those who believe in other divisions ? one statue unbroken, half precise-half fine, 
precise broken into fine on descent, precise fineness, countable infinite, uncountable finite, fragments were breathed in or blown out

== ==

or maybe:
there was no statue or green Brilliant-Neon flash
a statue was destroyed by people, the Brilliant-Neon was something else, 
the statue was metaphorical, the rain was something else, 
some different structure was broken
nothing was broken, nothing happened but the story

And to continue their journey:		
a walk along the bridge.			
Less a boardwalk, 
more anti-promenade now.

Countless shades, 
drifting along, 
drained in hue,
but painted in dawn.		
 
Above, deep expanse. 				
Placid pool. 
Purple-Thick.
Almost clear, yet strewn with wisps. 	

Even here, their thoughts kept drifting up.
But it wasn't there, nothing was.

Less sky along the skyline though.
						
A word was recalled, 
one taught by travellers,
'Kirbir'.
This self-aggrandised city,
the Ringed City.

Its outline, once of shifted dirt,
sprouted into a tiara, 
then shut as a circlet.
Spires grew, 
and still grow.
They threaten to arch over,
to close the crown, 
and cage it all.

A self-appointed monarch,
adorned with gems,
'bartered' from others.

No wonder it's own jewel was smashed.
No wonder that jewel was shattered and crushed, 
and spread with the wind as dust.

Between the buildings,
fallen day peeked.
Themselves more like gems.
Ruby-Splendour glowed in spots,
bursting with Crimson, 
yet slowly sinking at the speed of night. 		
			
With rationed heat pulled from fading embers, 
bright tendrils s p r e a d from the mass,
reaching far above the city edge, 
cooling into the darkness that was slowly encroaching.
 
Now they reached the quadrangle. 
Massive.
Slightly sunken, 
in fact, 
noticeably lower than the surrounding areas.		

It felt so open, 					
this place did. 
The world above
and around, 
all seemed to expose this spot. 					

As though a show were to commence. 
As though they were to sink below
or immediately be swept up into the sky.	

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 

Night almost in place, 
they finally reached their district.
They walked past an interesting sight: 		
a Magir, apparently at least,
spraying furious energy into the glowing core of a lamp-post.
Their arms held high, with fingers dancing about.	

Sharp strands of Brilliant-Neon shot out from their hands, 
flashing between Blue and Yellow.
The bulb responded with calm breathes, 
dimming softly into darkness, 
before gleaming brightly a different shade,
sometimes two at once.

A small group marvelled at this display, 
as did one of the travelling duo, 
who was quickly ushered forward by the other.

"Come, come now Vani. 
We need to reach the inn before someone takes our room, again. 
You wouldn't want to spend another sleepless night in the park, would you?"

"Ah, no, of course not. 
But...that...was something wonderous. 
Who are those people? 
I've seen a few of them around town."

"Oh, you mean the Order of Electrical Showoffs?"

"Are they Magir?"

"Yes, of a kind. 
They are entertainers, not much more. 
Don't be too enamored with them, 
they haven't much use outside amusing onlookers."

"But they can create it themselves right? Brilliant-Neon?"

"Hmm, yes. They can. 
If they could be willing to do so for research then that would be actually useful. 
However, 
their leader strictly prohibits the participation of members in anything worthwhile, such as empirical research. 
Only entertainment, they pledge."

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

They crossed the eventual street.			
Two stores sat ahead.

One for cloth, 
glowing with a Tangerine-Mellow.			
Dense reams of drapery, 
seen through the front display, 	
echoing their way down, 						
all into the shadowed walls.

And to it's right, 
a puppet shop. 
Same shade as a leaf plucked freshly for tea.
Strewn with wooden dolls along its display.
Though, 
if one squinted past these, 
the rest of the shop would emerge, 
covered in all manner of wonderous marionnettes - 
of every size, every material, every shape, 
and of every level of intricacy that one could possibly imagine. 
Or at least that the creators could.		

A strip of doorway sat open between these two much wider buildings. 	
Demarked with Amber-Thin.
This entry was the inn. 

The hallway in was also rather narrow. And as one pair went in, another were to come out, carrying a bedframe. One of the pair crouched, Vani hoped the two could just step over them. But Pers stood firm only nudging aside slightly, and making the whole experience longer for everyone.

"Hey, are you going to move or what?" said the front carrier, their shoulder balancing an Indigo frame, lacquered and made of bars somewhat fancifully curved to resemble floral shapes.

"Just raise the frame above your heads, and move past me. It's not that difficult."

"Not that difficult!?" the rear frame-carrier yelled, "This frame is made of dulium! Metal bars filled with even more dense metal! This thing weighs more than your ego, so just move aside!"

"Pers, just let them go past." Vani stated, their words apparently being drowned out by the angry voices around them.

As the two and one argued, not much progress being made, firm steps and an angry voice grabbed everyone's notice.

"Stop blocking the entranceway! Out! All of you!" She yelled, sweeping everyone onto the street nearly by sheer will of voice alone.

The four, now outside, looked at each other sheepishly before turning back to the door. Even as a silhouette, the Manager's furious aura burned obvious through Amber-Eyes.

"You two." 

She pointed at the lifters.

"I've sent pay to your company, so that's all I have today." 

She waved vaguely at the large bedframe.

One of the lifters jittered into a curtesy, "Oh, um, th--thank you, Madam. We will be off then." 

And the two hurried off with the frame. Or at least attempted to, struggling to do so with any grace due to the immense weight of the thing. But, eventually, they faded into the shadows down the street.

Turning her attention to the remaining pair, which immediately pulled their focus, the Manager sighed, dropping her shoulders.

"Just, come inside. And try not to cause trouble before you get to the room, Pers."

Pers tucked his lips in, dramatically flipping his coat over his shoulder and striding in. All Vani could do was shake their head, and follow along.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 

Beyond the narrow entranceway, behind the front desk, at the end of the building was the Manager's room. Filled with the warmth, smell and glow of a long-sustained fire, it was almost unreasonably comfortable for such a small space - a single window propped open to keep some semblance of airflow going.

Three pillows were set up in front of the fire, a drinks tray set behind them. The Manager went for her spot - a seemingly well-practiced act that involved snatching a glass and bottle off the tray, yanking out the cork, pouring out a generous amount of liquid and guzzling it down just in time to plop down onto her cushion.

Pers paused at the drinks tray though immediately nudged forward, grumbling lightly and taking a place to the Manager's left with Vani on his left.

Other than the crackling fire, the only other sound in the room was the manager gulping down another large portion of drink.

Vani looked over at their protege, who, expectedly, was staring at the drink like someone was drinking gold.

She finished the glassful with a heavy sigh, lifting the bottle and almost pouring another portion but instead re-closing the bottle.

ÅgSoÅcÅh she began, turning to eye the two sternly. Her face was mostly obscured with shadows but Amber glinted through easily, Åg...anything useful?Åh

ÅgWell, the buns they sell on the southern coast are divine.Åh Pers replied.

She raised her eyebrow, a clear, deep scowl not budging.

"God be praised?" He added with a shrug.

Vani sighed and spoke up, ÅgWe did try but...we, uh, didnÅft find anything.Åh 

ÅgNothing, huh?Åh The manager slouched forward, pouring a tiny portion out and quickly sipping it down.

ÅgAnything on your end?Åh Pers asked.

ÅgNope.Åh

Pers glanced back at the drinks tray, ÅgSame as always.Åh 

????????????????????????????????????????????

city is trying to push forward with secular unification, administratively stagnating religious initiatives such as a funded pilgrimage road with attractions, temple repairs, expansion of religious teaching programs or protection of church controlled materials - there are many religiously divisive issues but the statue is seen as the lynchpin, but could not be directly or indirectly targeted by the city

the three all dislike the current state of things but also hold slightly different views on the matter:

- the manager thinks even as sloppily and poorly done the process is, encouraging a moving beyond the statue is necessary since she considers the whole thing superstitution and conflicts based on superstition aren't beneficial - only physical matters are beneficial and the need to orient the city around such is apparent to her

- Pers thinks the enterprise is doomed to fail even though he would prefer the city does try something forward-thinking but also does not see unity as declared by one group as desireable - not particularly bothered if truthes are lost or not

- Vani thinks the truth of the statue matter is out there and that the city is purposefully acting to squash knowledge - also as a religious sort, at least culturally, hates themselves for the fake work they're partaking in in dealing with the statue and that the city is acting anti-religiously but also dislikes the ways that the religious fervour have manifested currently such as with the financial lyings of their council member client

????????????????????????????????????????????

She casually took a small log and tossed it into the fire, ÅgThey postponed judgement on the Route again."

"Really don't want anything distracting from their 'little project', huh?" Vani stated.

Their partner chuckled, "Heh, they're going to bury the process in delays. Hope everyone forgets, moves on, and, just like that, new unity."

"We'd be lucky to get councils to agree on meeting times," chimed the Manager.

After taking a few seconds for a sip, she continued, "Well at least they're trying something. We can't keep being stuck on unanswerable questions." 

"But it's not a problem to profit from it?" Vani asked pointedly.

The Manager shrugged, pouring another shot and brushing her lips with the glass edge before lowering it again. "If you mean them, then maybe? They still take taxes and fines and payments without giving the services owed. That's a cheat." 

She danced her cup around, Clear-Liquid shining from Orange-Flames captured within, then looks up at Vani, "If you mean us? Then, yeah." She continued, "For right now? We might as well take advantage of the City's uselessness."

"Somebody's got to." Pers added, with another chuckle at the end. 

The glass raises again, and she floats it in front of her mouth, "Besides, it's only for a little while longer. The winds are changing and soon we'll have to change everything."

Pers and Vani echoed the same words identically, "What do you mean?"

The Manager laughed, she put down the cup and bottle then resettled into a new slouch. "I've heard whisperings of a guild, or something like that, for every profession that can be named."

"What, like in the old days of other places? They want to import that as an idea?" Pers asked.

She shrugged, "You can never know what those ink-stainers are thinking. But, apparently, it would mean that we would have to register. We would have to do 'honest work'," she shook her head, "whatever that means to them. And we would have to pay for 'the honour of being registered'."

"So you would have to reorganise how you budget things." Vani said.

"Everything! This would change everything! Who I contract, who I contact. Where I send my people. Even which side of the bed I sleep on!"

"All because they want a 'clean slate' on which to build unity." Pers said, "If this is true, then they'll have to do big things to organise this. Which means they want to do even bigger things with this in place."

"Creation of a councillor's utopia. Everything orderly and categorised nicely. Easy to represent on two-sided poster, or a twenty page report." The Manager scoffed.

"With everything irrelevant pushed beyond the margins." Vani said harshly, the other two nodding in agreement. 

Pers turned to the Manager at this, "Wait, I thought you wanted them to move forward?"

"They have no talent for organisation! They can't move at all! They will only harm if they start making plans too grand for their clumsy fingers, like a dullard of a farm boy at a drawing board!"

Pers laughed, turning to look at the drinks tray again.

Vani slightly winced at the metaphor, but nodded in agreement all the same. 

"They need to focus on providing what the city needs right now. Not on what the councils feel interested in for the future." She finished, staring at Vani's chest for minute, which they eventually noticed.

Blue-?ak??ma glowed from their front pocket, and they pulled out a pulsating crystal, rough-cut into a shape like a sea-cucumber. 

"Hahhh..." Vani rose, shaking the gem until it silenced, "Time to work." 

"That your pickups start so late now, that feels like a cheat." Pers said. 

"Yes, and the work has been getting drier and drier. Soon they will ask me to carry one sheet of silk and then go home." Their protege responded.

"Perhaps a guild would do you some good." The Manager mused, "Then you would have assured work at consistent times. Or at least proper ones. Are you sure that you work for a real organisation?" She asked with a smirk.

Vani paused at the doorway, "I wonder..." They said, heading off with some last words, mainly pointed at Pers, "Don't drink too much."

"I promise to hold my head up!" He responded, immediately grabbing four bottles and two cups to the amusement of the Manager.

Standing outside in the quiet night, Vani slouched back onto the now shut front door and gazed up.

"Sometimes it feels like all my work now is fake." They softly said.

Clear and calm as ever.
Even the stars could not hide.
So where was it all?
Where does it hide? In what sky?

They stopped their thoughts of above and turned down to the street ahead. They needed to go to the office, get the location and do their job. A lonely walk awaited them.

Thoughts

I'm thinking about making Vani different from 'able-bodied' in some sense. I want to create a sense of 'difference' with them. I mean, yes, they are enby and have a post-colonial mentality, and I will *need* to make that clear in how they see the world. But, also, ever since Eastshade got my hopes up (I thought that because of the character who said of their brother losing a leg/arm that it wasn't the worst since the brother lived as opposed to treating it like the worst possible fate, worse than death which is part of ableism, and also the presence in the first small town of the ramp next to the stairs - I figured it was accessibility in action) and then dashed them (the game has a couple of wheelchaired characters who are prominently defined by feelings of lost potential and being trapped - which if it was a statement about the disabling nature of society would be one thing, but no, it's just a statement that disability status sucks and is only downsides - you're not different, the game says, you're just worse) of being set in a world that is specifically anti-ableist. 

So I wanna make this world anti-ablist, but partly in a govt self-motivated sense and also the reflected reaction to the pretend concern - like a sort of greenwashing equivalent of inclusivity vs the feelings of those who aren't included? 

Nahh, I do want genuine inclusion and a character that feels *great* regardless of how their body might be perceived by folk in our world. 

Maybe, the govt pretending but also it tapping into long held beliefs of inclusivity, held back by imperialistic ideals of what to focus on. 

I dunno - I want the idea of inclusivity being an outcome of the govt trying to cynically bring people together, but also I want a society that is anti-ableist and the two are very hard to blend.

And I don't just want these ideas expressed through a side character (maybe I could make several characters have disabilities? and maybe use a different term in my story, I dunno, I think in a world where its acceptable the term 'disabled' would be perceived as too emphatic on what someone has lost rather than what they have...
