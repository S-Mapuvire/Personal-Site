it was always kinda odd 
									this part of the job 

		sitting 
							waiting
			watching 

			
				a bathtub 
		
		all alone 						in this dingy room
			
				a robin's egg 
					half-melted
					split open
					lit bright 
						like on display 
							
							in this 
						steel decay
						spray of grey
								and brown
	inside?
				liquid 
					not water
						too wavy
						too chunky
						too shiny

	it's...'company goo'...
		the...goo...sat still...

					with an arm stuck out
						tough as hurt feelings
							stiff as a old jokes 
			a tad bit lower
		it would almost appear					
				relaxed
					like a pampered spa goer
		instead?
				no head
				no shoulders
				all gone
					
						submerged
				
					but it's okay
						it's
							not exactly human
							they'd laugh at her if she said that
			raised carapace
				erased texture
		 dead giveaways

but, 
still
		some-one/thing was buried there
							...does goo 'bury'...?
			like a bathplug with ears

it always felt weird
			humanoid, dogdroid 
						any other kind of simulacra
				it felt 
				wrong 
					to her
					to just sit there as...it's bathing?
						where the air cannot reach
						where the eye cannot see
they're supposed to remove the parts
	clean them individually
		but she found this worked just as well
			well, twice as half almost, 
				so why not?
watching used to be...
	hellish?
	guilt-inducing?
	heart-activating?
	exciting?
										...fun?
	uh, no no no no
			
			but now, it was just a job, 
		with fizzes and spritzes of feelings

even in regards to this part
there was plenty more to the job
there was fun

she checked her wrist
	1 minute left, her fLoW displayed
she waved over it again,
	11:39 pm
she squinted,
	another whole day gone
she sighed, 
	whatever, least the fun can start now

○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○
she flicked her wrist
palid white filled her view
a square, popped out

		"Day Zero Exploit Found in Altru Software"
			...eye roll...
				again?
							good ol' "Day Zero Altru"
she had a theory 
	Altru made secret backdoors for some part of the government
							but poorly, every time
							and they got leaked, every time
	but who knows?
		all she knew was when they mess up 
			'they' as in other defence specialists in other companies

		then they all had pressure on them
	'they' and 'them' as in herself
			well
				just her, really
				this is mostly about her

		and were seen as sloppy, 
			untrustworthy, incompetent
			foolish

*Clank*
And with that, the final portion of barracade was officially put in place, materialising the ring in completeness for the first time. Sotenbori, one of the first-round locations, with at least two matches happening here, hopefully would prove a spectacular venue.
In a room located near the ring, Hyena sat alone in stillness. Or he would have if not for the near-constant dripping noise, plus the audible heaving in and out of air through the room like in some whale's chest cavity. It was a bare room - just a couple of benches in the centre, with a tap and mirror behind them, and covered in grey cement. 
He was in his customary green suit with sunglasses on, which in a highly darkened room might seem unnecessary but he was rather used to donning shades in low light conditions. And so he sat, arms and legs crossed, heading slowly bobbing as though to a rhythm of the breeze.
Suddenly, a long, heavy creek predicated the metal door slowly pushing open with the sound of boots thudding in. Hyena kept his head down, hoping he could predict who it was without looking. 
'Boots?' he thought. 'Also, a rather regular step to them - sure footed, plus they haven't said anything yet, must not think too highly of me, then. Hmmm...probably...one of those Ikari mercenaries...'
He turned his head up to see Leona Heidern, with an inscrutable blank expression complete with stern eyes simply observing him. He cackled softly under his breath, "Heh, knew it."
"So, you're my first team-mate huh?" He said, "I feel rather lucky, having someone as skilled and dangerous as you on my team, rather than against."
She kept her eyes firmly on Hyena, replying, "I hope you are aware...that your actions with Mephastopheles have not been forgotten. Not by me, nor by the relevant authorities."
"So you're actually here to apprehend me?" He turned his head down, shaking it mournfully, "Didn't take you for such paltry grunt work. I mean, I wasn't exactly high on the totem pole of the organisation."
"No, you were not. And you're definitely not on my list of priorities, urgent or otherwise."
"That hurts."
"However, I will not pretend as though we aren't aware of your past connections and dealings. Make no mistake, you are still an untried criminal as far as I, and my organisation, are concerned."
"So, what you're saying is, something like: 'Don't push your luck because I can bag you for just sneezing wrong'? Or maybe 'Don't think that just because we're on the same team, that I won't take your ass to the darkest, coldest cell at a moment's notice'?"
"I'll leave the interpretations up to you." She finally let her gaze waver from him, crossing her arms and scanning the room, "Do you know who our third team member is yet?"
"Oh, back to tournament talk now? Hmph, alright. No, I don't know who our team-mates are. I don't even know who our opponents are. Heh, some organisers, huh? Couldn't even let us know how we're up against early."
She turned her head back to him, still standing by the door, "Well, they told me."
"Oh? And?"
"Maxima, Athena Asamiya, and Ash Crimson."

The wind picked up, forcing a large pull of breath in between all the creaks and gaps in the ventilation fixtures and loosened brickwork. Although it was a small room, it was also a rather cold one as little in the way of insulation was applied to any of the walls or ceiling. And so frigid silence sat between the pair, puncutated with whistles of wind streaming across the room.
Leona continued studying the room - moreso as a means to actively remain in the present, she couldn't let her thoughts drift. 'I wonder if those three are strategising now?'. It didn't really matter whether she stayed in this tournament or not, the real work laid in the soon-to-come.
Hyena meanwhile fell into a deep moment of memory assessment, trying to recall all the facets of information that he had to memorise last time when acting as a sort of tournament liasson meets host meets show-runner.  
Finally with a dramatic start, emphasing his first word, Hyena spoke up again, "Alright. So...Ms. Asamiya? Right? Okay, I'm familiar enough with her. And I think (emphasis on that 'think') that I may have heard a thing or two about that Maxima person. But, as for this 'Ash Crimson'...nothing comes to mind." He turned over to Leona, sternly obseving him. "Care to enlighten me?'
She turned away from Hyena, going back to regarding the exposed brickwork in the corner of the room, "He's a mysterious one, he is. Not much info out."
"Really? Not even a note of what kind of moves he employs?"
"He uses fire," she replied sharply. Then, glancing back at Hyena, said, "Lots of green flames."
"Oh-ho. Now that's something! I'll bet it looks great in photos. Probably nice accent lighting in headshots. Speaking of headshots - you ever considered taking a couple? I know a few bang-out people who could really get you some modelling work?"
He chuckled at the not unexpected silent response. Barely a notice. 
"Heh. Just a thought."
Another groaning creek appeared as the door again started to open. Leona took a couple of steps to her left and in came their third team-mate, dressed in a casual attire with a sports bag slung over her shoulder.
Her head very quickly orbited the room, eyes wide and searching, increasingly desperately looking for a sliver of hope in what she had walked into. 
"Wait..." Her head froze sharply straight ahead, realising that she could easily see the entire space from this gaze, "...this is the changing room?!"
Hyena looked down, shaking his head, "Oh dear."
Leona silently released a sigh, "Mai Shiranui. So you're our final team-mate huh?"
Mai frantically turned to the sudden voice, having been too absorbed in the dismay-inducing state of the room. "Hey, it's you!" she yelled, still wearing distress on her face. She then looked over at the benches, "Oh...I remember you..." she stated flatly, pointing limp wristedly at Hyena, as though identifying a stray cricket that had wandered into her room.
"Oh come on. I know that I don't have the best reputation but I do have feelings you know?"
"Hm. I'll keep that mind, maybe. Anyway, more importantly....where am I supposed to change?! I know KOF's been running a bit cheap for some years now - especially last year - but this is unacceptable!"
Leona stepped back, leaning against the wall, "So did they tell you our opponents?"
"Haah, yeah...Athena, Maxima and that Ash person, right?"
"That's correct," Leona replied
"So..." Hyena started, "what's our order going to be?"
Mai dejectedly wandered to the second bench, curently empty, and placed her bag down. 
Leona in turn moved back to her earlier position by the door, "I'm going first," she declared. "We need to start aggressively, rattle the opponent."
"Mmmmn, mmmn. I like your style, maybe you mercernary cutthroats ain't so bad!" Hyena laughed, "Okay and then second will be...?"
"You, of course," Leona stated.
"Me?? W-why I'm a showstopper! Not a stop-gap!"
"You really want to go against Ash Crimson? Recall what I said? Green flames? I don't know if you'd be comfortable with immolation."
This time Mai spoke, looking up from carefully pulling out her costume, "How do you know they'll put Ash last?"
"Because none of us know much about him. Probably no one in the tournament does. Would seem kind of a waste to just stick him in at the front, don't you think?" She checked her wristwatch quickly, "Besides, it's not Ash that I'm worried about here."
"It's not?" Hyena asked.
"What?! The?! Hell?! Why is the tap water slimy??!"  Mai screamed from the singular sink with hands covered in a grey, translucent fluid. 
"Nope," Leona continued, "it's Maxima. He can take a ton of damage, I know. And outside of me and Shiranui, we might be lacking in the area of sufficient damage."
Still at the tap, Mai yelled, "Oh god!! Now the tap won't close!! Could one of you help?!?!" 
"I take offence to that." Hyena stated, slowly getting up towards Leona. "I mean, I'm no braggart but...I've been winning a few street tournaments here and there. I'm pretty tough and I can dish the damage out," he said, putting his fists up in a faux-boxer stance.
*Bang!! *
The pipe under the sink now had a massive dent in its middle, reducing the 'water' to a slow drip out the faucet. 
Mai chimed in, wiping her arms judiciously, "Yeah, sure you can. And I'm a master grappler, so we're basically unbeatable. Face it pal, you're the least experienced here and you haven't faced off against any of the KOF regulars. We're not like the street fighters you may've swept through."
"Hey I--wait...you're fighting in a raincoat? I guess it is a change from your usual outfit, how long have you worn that old thing anyway? Also what's that smell? Smells like week-old frog guts!"
"Shut it. I'm gonna change into my costume in the ring. You know, like a ninja?"
Cutting in between the two, Leona continued strategy talk, "So Maxima is straightforward. He's durable, he's faster than he looks, he hits harder than lightning, and he's got reach."
"Then what do we do if we face him?" Hyena asked.
"Stay in his face and hit hiim with your fastest strikes. Though. I've got a feeling he's going to be their first pick, so I wouldn't worry too much about him."
"I mean...unless you lose..." Mai said, pulling a water bottle out of her bag.
"Losing is always an option, but you always have to plan as though it ain't."
Hyena began on the next opponent, "Athena Asamiya...I'll probably have to end up fighting her."
"Probably." Leona replied.
"Then, I think I can take her. She's fast, but I'm tricky. Not to mention that I've seen dozens of her fights, and I doubt she's seen even one of mine."
"I don't think any of us have." Mai snarked, "This might as well be your debut!" 
"Just you wait! My dazzling style will steal the show in due time. Then everyone's going to forget all about ol' Red Ball Shiranui! Seriously though, what is that thing? Your costume's got haemerroids or something?"
"And finally," Leona announced, "Ash Crimson. He's going to be mostly your opponent Mai. I don't know much about him."
"Me neither." Mai said, followed with a sigh, "I'll just have to adapt quickly and see what he can do!"
Hyena excitedly clapped his hands together, "Alright! Then we're all ready to go! Time to shine!"

The area where the fighting would happen was in the more populous part of the city with waves of people casually walking along in the further background and an entire perimeter of a main crowd eager for the match.
Maxima was standing in the centre of the stage, appearing to wait patiently for the match to begin. He was actually up to two tasks mainly. 
First was monitoring his vitals constantly, checking when something spiked out of control or something else lagged and threatened to stop. Professor Makishima was in his trio's secret care now (wasn't easy) but it would be a while before he can finish analysing the results of Maxima's condition and specify exactly what he needs to fix him. In the meantime, the three just needed to act as usual whilst killing time. And so they figured that the tournament would be the best way to avoid suspicions of doing anything, especially before Makishima fixes his Inertia Engine. 
For an instant, Maxima's thoughts suddenly drifted to K' and Kula, wondering what unlucky duos would have to deal with each of their personalities. 
'Long as K' isn't instigated too much, he'd play nice with others.' Maxima thought. 'But then again...there are a couple of people here who'd definitely push his buttons without trying...' As for Kula, 'Well, I just hope Princess doesn't get someone who treats her like a kid too much, or encourages her. That's the option that I'm more worried about...but if I'm being serious, what I'm actually worried about is...'  
His subroutines kept sending a non-stop flow of information to him, partially pertaining to his vitals, but also pertaining to his second task: very carefully monitoring the state of the buildings overlooking the fighting square. 
Athena was right at the barricade, signing autographs for every piece of paper, poster, album case, on-tour DVD documentary, toy microphone, plushie, and autograph book presented to her. She was surprised at the number of fans here to see her, she would really have to make a good showing for them all. Maybe even sing a little after the fight. Throughout the signings, she kept tilting her attention towards the buildings nearby. 'Whoever it is, they're not moving. How long have they been there?'' she wondered, making an effort to appear unconcerned by indulging in her fans.
Ash Crimson sat seemingly dispassionately in the corner of the area, staring vaguely up at the sky. Though at the same timee, side-eyeing the all the same buildings that the other two were very aware of. He wondered what kind of people were stationed there, watching them so intently? Maybe he could quickly run up a building and settle things before the match started? He just needed to capture one. Then again probably the instant he moved towards any of them, they would all run. So what's better than to just sit there, casually, and pretend as though it didn't cause him any bother?

As the crowd started opening up a tunnel, the three knew what was up and went into the centre of the fighting area. Leona, followed by Hyena, then Mai passed the barricade, and then met the other trio. 
Mai walked ahead of her group, "So, you guys ready to lose?" she teased, still in her massive overcoat.
"That's good, starting out with confidence! It'll make your defeat less depressing." Maxima replied with a grin, making Mai almost wish she was up first.
Hyena stood slightly away from the rest, eyeing the opposition through his sunglasses and especially looking over at Ash, who also stood away from the main group.
'Well. I don't know what to make of him. Lean, so he's probably fast. But, then again...Duke could move like a bull on rocket-skates, so I'm not sure if I can tell how fast he moves. He's trying to look all cool and casual though. Hmph, that's my schtick buddy! Also, he's got a further reach than me, if those arms work proper. Still, green fire huh? Heh, sounds nasty.' 
An official called out the first two combantants: Maxima and Leona. The rest dispersed, standing just outside the barricade split in their two teams. 
Maxima paced a little along the centre, hands behind his head, stopping once Leona had stepped forward. "Had a feeling you'd go first," he said from a side-glance, "was really hoping for a tough fight."
Leona stood across from him, stretching her arms and legs, "And you don't think my team-mates would make for tough fights?"
"Not like you" he replied with a grin, finally turning to face her head-on.  He briefly considered mentioning the unknown watchers, but decided against it - maybe they were listening and would run at the mention of their presence. Besides, he had logged their positions, heat signatures, and sizes, he had time to track them all down later. However before he could fully focus on the fight, Leona suddenly spoke up, "Maxima. I've noticed."
He chuckled in surprise, nodding appreciatively, 'Well, guess I should've known better. She's only been here five minutes and already noticed them. We'll all have to do something after this match.'
"You ever seen him fight?" Hyena asked to Mai before turning to his right and noticing her attention seemed far away, 'Huh? Fight hasn't started yet and she's already concentrating? Never took her for the serious type, even in battle.'
'Who is it? ' Mai wondered, having already sensed the some presence skulking on a rooftop nearby, 'KOF's already normally filled with underhanded business like this, so why add to it? I'm gonna go over to those jerks and give 'em a real reason to hide. Well, that at least explains the other team's tension when we came, it's not like we're that intimidating. Probably Leona also noticed, but I'm not so sure about...' She turned to Hyena who had already been staring at her for the past minute. Making sudden eye-contact surprised them both. 
"Gah!! Why the hell were you staring at me, you underworld creep!!" Mai yelled.
"What?! I was trying to talk to you earlier and you completely ignored me, you jerk!!" Hyena replied.
Mai turned her attention back to the fight, "Whatever!"

The mage floated carefully down the main path, searching for any sign of them.
Blinding shafts of sun pierced into the empty space through the outer wall openings.
A darkened parking floor, cut up with white triangles into black squares filled with fuzzy grey in between. 
Yet, in light or in shade, the mage's white cape shined without fail, like clouds hiding the sun. And her orange sigils, dotted all over her button-up and trousers, glowed pure - intense. And her helmet cut into a rounded polyhedron, was so glassy, so glossy that it looked hand painted. 
Suddenly, from behind, feet scuttled, fleeing for the stairs.
She turned and shot herself straight at them. 
Even though they were at the opposite end, her flight speed was way too good. Plus it was no good running whilst carrying the heavy device. 
Inches away, her hand reached out, ready to snatch them. 

But, suddenly, something banged into her helm, stopping her motion dead. 
"Wha--?!"
It was a foot, someone's foot had stomped onto her helmet. And before she could react, it instantly pushed her off. She was thrown into a ragged, spinning mess, bouncing off the ground once before forcefully righting herself and facing her foe. 
Over in the blur of shadows, she caught the target and the device flee down the stairs. 
And then, landing on bouncy toes, the cause of her annoyance crouched in the way. A black cat mask, large green eyes, and red hair were the first things she noticed. Very quickly though, the fact that it was clearly a kid made itself clear too. 
The redhead smirked, ready to go, "Seems you're pretty tough! Lemme guess, magic armor?"
Pushing all the immediate questions out of her mind, the mage shook her head and yelled, "Out of my way, you little...trick-or-treater! What even are you dressed up as?! Whatever, leave! I don't have time to babysit!"
Her foe scoffed, "You're one to talk about costumes! And if you think I'm such an easy target, then go ahead. Beat me, and get past, Domehead!"
"You...fool-girl!"

One burst forward threw the mage with max momentum to attack, but the girl held her smile.
A furious swing: ducked. 
The follow-up kick: side-stepped.
And an elbow strike: backed away from. 
But the force of that last strike left them off-balance, if there was such a thing whilst levitating, and the cat-masked foe leaned in, grabbing the mage's arm and flipping them over, aimed for the wall. 
Quick telekinesis helped soften the impact, and prevent a head-first landing on the way down. But it did nothing to stop their opponent from taunting.
"Had enough yet? Or are you ready for me to get serious?" The fighter in black tights mocked, not waiting for an answer. 
She dashed forward, changing the distance into a memory and the mage could only manage a half-gasp before a strong spin-kick gave her flight straight into the pillar by the wall. One furious stomp crumpled her into her newly formed divot, then came the second and third, pushing her deeper. 
And the girl had plenty to say, letting each word be punctuated with another vicious kick.
"By! The! Way! Name's! Not! 'Fool Girl'! It's! Lu-cky! Girl!!!" 
This last stomp shattered the pillar in two, and Lucky Girl hopped back out of range. The huge support fell forward and collapsed onto the mage. Or, it would have if the mage hadn't used a spell. A yellow forcefield domed around her with the hunk of concrete floating effortlessly above. She pulled herself up and shuffled aside, leaving the pillar to smash halfway into the floor. 
The weird feeling, buzzing in her head throughout the fight, finally became recognisable to the young hero, "You! You have a Charm of Bezel!! Levitation!"
The mage paced back and forth, patting dirt off their scuffed outfit, to little noticeable effect. 
"Of course! You're totally channelling it's power to fly! Plus whatever mega-strong spells you've got on for armor and strength."
No answer as her foe pulled her cape around to her front, dusting it off as well with increasingly wide sweeps of the hand. 
Lucky Girl squared up, "Well I can't let a baddie like you hold onto it. Let's make it easy, give me the charm, and we don't have to see who'd win in a round 2." She concluded, leaning in slightly.
With one last exaggerated sweep of her coat, the mage sent her arm straight up at the hero.
"Repulsa!"
Green eyes shocked wide were sent flying away at speed down the lot.  
"Levitas"
And her flight backwards curved up, bashing hard into the ceiling. 
"Comboros!"
And finally, she was sent straight into the ground.

"Oof!" 
She landed rearside and immediately jumped up to find...no one.
"Ugh, where could they've...?" 
She stopped herself and pulled her thoughts in a more useful direction, "She was after that person. So, she's wherever they are...but where?"
She walked a tiny circle, "Couldn't have gone far. Running outside seems super risky now. Especially with that heavy whatever-it-was that they had. Would be better to just hunker down somewhere and hide. And Domehead's gotta know that too...so--woooah!"
The floor, and walls, and pillars and everything else shook violently, and she knew instantly to go to the ground floor, "No! No! No! Please don't cave in the place!"

"I KNOW YOU ARE STILL IN HERE!!"
The voice boomed almost as loud as the rocking building. Lucky Girl continued sprinting down the stairs.

"SHOW YOURSELF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OR I. WILL. COLLAPSE THIS BUILDING!!"
Whilst the young hero wasn't sure tearing apart the builiding was in the mage's best interests, at all, the shaking was more than enough to seem convincing.

"HURRY UP! YOUR WINDOW FOR ESCAPING IS CLOSING!!"
She almost reached the bottom of the stairs as she heard a loud cry.

"Please! Please, don't crush me! I give up, I'm here!"
The masked girl touched the ground floor and slinked behind a pillar to watch the person, carrying the boxy contraption, walk to the mage, visibly shaken even more than the building.
"I have half a mind to tear you in half after all I've been through! But...it's finally over."
"Urgh, I need to do something fast. Can't just let 'em just leave," Lucky Girl whispered to herself, "Alright...might as well try..."
She lifted a palm and called out the spell, "Gallius interruptus!"
A strong wind picked up the mage, twisting and spinning them upwards to smash into the ceiling.
The would-be kidnapee was yelled at, "Hey! You! Run!"
Immediately, they went for the exit, their path then quickly covered by the super charged kid. 
After a few seconds, the mage fell down with a thud on her butt but sprang right up and, with a voice even louder than before, screamed, "YOU ARE A PAIN! I. WILL. END YOU!! REVOLTA!!"
Her magic push sent Lucky Girl flying back again, this time straight into a fire hydrant across the street, which left her backside and in front of an empty coffeeshop. 
"LEVITAS!"
Struggling to get up, she felt herself lifted quickly and realised what was coming next. 
Her back banged into an overarching lightpost, "Urgh! Not this time!" 
She quickly grabbed on the horizontal post, putting all her superhuman strength into pulling herself into a tight swing and flinging herself backwards, out of the spell's range and onto the coffeeshop roof. 
"YOU DO NOT GET TO RUN!!" 
The mage leapt up, soaring over the building and scanning for her opponent.
Nothing. 
They spun their head around, looking every way. Suddenly, something called out from behind.
"Hey, Fish Bowl! You're not the only one who can fly!" 
Turning showed Lucky Girl on some sort of fast-moving, giant, flying square. And with a punch primed to hit.
*BAM*
"Guuuhhh!!" 
The hit sent the mage over the coffeeshop to smash right into the parking lot of a restaurant behind it, making quite a dent in the concrete and skidding over onto the sidewalk. 
Lucky Girl landed the hoverboard nearby and ran over to her barely crawling foe. "Woah, still moving, huh? You are super tough. But, you can't move too much. So, lemme just..."
Using a chain from the parking lot entranceway, she tied the mage to a nearby light pole, making sure to give one good finger flick on the helmet. 
"Just rest a while, till the cops come for you! Ha ha! And that's another win for Lucky Girl!"
A loud blast took her out of her celebration, reminding her of the dangers outside and so she hurried back onto the hoverboard, "Right, better go see if the Dweeb needs help!" 
? ? ? ? ?
*Make longer*

She flew for a minute or two on the hoverboard, doing her best to head towards where Ben was. Street after street was empty and blasted to pieces until shereached where Fourarms was taking on the reason this part of town was abandoned - one of Vilgax's mega-large droids. Bad enough luck that the fishbowl mage was causing trouble, but for it to be at the same time as a Vilgax croney. 
Though, Ben was handling it well enough, so she decided to hang back on a nearby rooftop, rather than just jump-in and maybe cause more trouble than helping.
Besides, he did say he could handle it all on his own. Sooooo...
"But, then again...Ben's probably halfway drained on watch-time. Oh, well. Guess we'll see."
That made her wonder how much energy she had on the Keystone. Pulling up her right sleeve showed the spot where it had incorporated itself into her form, marked with its distinctive pattern of lines partially filled in with a purple glow to indicate how much magical charge she still had. Surpisingly, the mage had taken almost half of energy. 
"Guess they were way stronger than I gave credit. I would've been toast if I wasn't careful." 
The wind picked up and she instinctively closed her eyes, though, really, it was a pleasant feeling. 
Even though Ben was busy fighting, that all felt a million miles away and where she was right now - the wind, the calm - felt relaxing. 
Feeling the flow of the Keystone's energy pulsate from that spot was also nice, it was always kinda entrancing. It felt comforting, in a way that went a bit past just being able to kick butt at a moment's notice.
Well, almost at a moment's notice.
Since the Keystone was a part of her now: when it drained, she was drained. 
No in-between. 
No 'kinda tired'. 
She was either ready to go, or couldn't move at all.
It was scary to think about that, losing all muscle power once she was tapped out. 
So she always had to check.
It wasn't the most comforting arrangement.
But it was the only choice she had. 
That was what she thought back then. And thinking about, she still agrees. This sent her into a nostalgic mood. She thought back to how she got the Keystone.

? ? ? ? ?

Gwen sat at the back of the RV, reading more about the lost Keystone of Bezel before joining up with the others at the magic show. Her attention was caught on a particular site that mentioned a rumored way to destroy the Keystone. 
"Destroy it?! Heck, no! But..." She turned her wrist, where the gauntlet holding the Keystone was, over, thinking hard, "It might just end up like the cemetary again. Wouldn't want anyone bad getting this. Hahhhh, alright, what the spell?" 
She scrawled the magic words on a torn notebook scrap. "Hope I'll never need this," she said, tucking the piece into her pocket.

Hours later, the Tennysons gazed up at the tower where Hex and Charmcaster were trying to restore the destroyed Charms of Bezel. Lucky Girl tightly clenched her fist, angry that she let the Keystone get swiped and hesitant about destroying another powerful artifact, but also determined not to let the magical duo capture such dangerous power for themselves. 
So she readied herself, reciting the spell again from memory - she had made sure to do so on the ride here.

After tussling with the two evil magicians, Charmcaster backstabbed Hex and was alone on the roof, about to receive the restore Charms. 
Landing behind her was Lucky Girl, "I'm not going to let you get your way!" She yelled.
"Feh, as if you can do anything, anymore." Was the calm reply, Charmcaster turning her back to the ceremony above.
The wind swirled around the micro solar system of the Keystone, bursting with energy, orbited by the now restored and glowing Charms.
A deep sigh came from the masked youngster, who then yelled out the spell.
Immediately the air felt...distorted. The wind slowed and stopped. No magical crackles of lightning erupted from the Keystone. And the Charms stopped spinning, instead they shook, violently before blasting out into five directions. Then the Keystone itself turned dark, changing into a ball of void shadow and pulling in all the magical energy in the vicinity. 
"Wha-what have you done?!" Charmcaster yelled as she felt her magic force drain from her body, losing consciousness. The magic flowed out of Hex, and even his staff. 
"This is...not what I expected. Wait..." At that moment, the shadowy Keystone shot itself straight at Gwen, who lifted up an arm in a last ditch attempt to protect herself before collapsing on the roof.

When she opened her eyes, she was back in the Rust Bucket, laying on the rear couch. 
"What...happened?" 
Ben was close-by and crouched up, "You fell or something while Grandpa and I were dealing with that falling coaster. We just found you out on the ground. We didn't know what happened and so we were rushing to the hospital!"
Max spoke up from behind the wheel, "Oh, thank goodness! Gwen, how are you? Don't worry, we're almost at the hospital!"
She struggled to sit up, "Urghh, I feel like...something hit me..." She swayed a little before falling back onto the couch.
"Woah, careful, we don't you passing out on us again!" Ben walked up to her, ready to catch her should she fall onto the floor.
"So, what about Hex and Charmcaster?" She said between deep breathes.
"Knocked out as well. What happened? The Keystone was gone when we got there and all three of you were out."
Gwen saw slices of memory return to her, "I'll tell you once we're done at the hospital. Everything's super hazy now."
Her cousin nodded, "You should probably slip on a sweater or something over that costume before we reach the hospital."
"Yeah, pass we a jacket?"


A few hours later, Gwen was admitted as having experienced total exhaustion, having completely passed out waiting for a doctor, and so was left to rest in a room for the night. 
Max and Ben made themselves comfortable in a couple of chairs, watching over her the whole time.
The next morning she woke up with heavy eyelids. Her relatives were hunched over in their chairs - next to each other bedside to her.
Every part of her body felt done, like she had spent the whole day running, lifting, swimming and jumping without a break. Nothing was responding to her desires to move. All she could do was groan and look left to right. 
"What's going on...? Why can't I move...? Ben, Grandpa..." She felt exhausted, even holding her eyes this open tired her out and soon, she fell asleep again. 



"...and we're not exactly sure what could be causing this."
"Hm. Okay."
She opened her eyes again to two figures talking above her bed. One was Grandpa Max, and the other...probably a doctor, she thought. She also noticed Ben, hovering by her side, with clear worry on his face.
"But that doesn't mean that it's something catastrophic. Again, it could simply be heat-induced exhaustion. Happens more often around these parts than you'd--"
Suddenly she felt the urge to get up, her body finally answering her request.
"Hey! She's awake!"
The three moved in closer to her, watching her closely.
Gwen yawned, stretching her arms out and sat up. "Hey. How's everyone doing?" She said rubbing her eye.
"Don't 'Hey' us! We thought you were never gonna wake!" Ben yelled, throwing his arms up.
"What?" Gwen replied.
Max filled her in, "You were asleep for a week. You didn't move or anything."
"What!?" Gwen replied, this time loudly.
The doctor stepped in, "Yes. We were all quite a bit worried, especially your cousin and grandfather here." She leaned in, looking over the ten year-old. "But, you look much healthier now. More energetic."
"Yep! Definitely feel alot more energetic now!"
"Well that's good." The doctor said, standing up and pulling out a notepad, "Perhaps we can send you home tomorrow, after a few tests."
"That would be great." Max said with a sigh of relief. "Thanks doc."
She smiled on her way out, "I'll call a nurse to give her a proper checkup."
Ben slumped back onto his chair, placed above her right shoulder, "You have no idea how much we thought it was some weird-magic-curse that those two creeps mighta put on you."
"Ben's right, ha ha! We weren't sure whether it was something medical or magical." Max sat down on her bed, smiling non-stop.
"Sorry I worried you two. But I am a lot better now."
"Yeah, we can tell." Ben said, "You didn't even move that much to breathe! Doc said it was like you were in a coma, but without being in one."
"Woah, that sounds scary."
"It was." Her grandfather momentarily dropped his smile before reassuming his happy face.
"So..." Ben started, "Do you remember now what happened on the roof?"
She sighed, leaning back into her pillow, "Yeah it--"
A knocking on the door interrupted them as a nurse came in to give Gwen a checkup.
Max stood up and grabbed Ben, "We'll go down to the mess hall and grab ya some food. We've been in this room all day, it's nearly supper time!"
"Alright, but hurry back!" She said, waving around the nurse who are busy checking her fluid levels.


Over a hospital dinner, Gwen explained everything she did and what happened.
Ben was blown away. "So the Charms just flew away! Like, they exist now??"
She nodded seriously, "Yep. Which means there's potential for more baddies like Hex to abuse them."
"At least no-one'll have all five, not for a while. So the chance of abuse is lessened." Max said.
"And the Keystone...flew at you?" Ben asked, looking his cousin carefully over.
"Yeah. I don't know where it went but that's when I passed out."
Ben excitedly yelled, "I still can't believe that you found some spell on the Internet and saved the day with it! That's not bad work for a hero!" 
"Ex-hero. But thanks."
"Hey, you're still a hero - powers or no powers."


? ? ? ? ?

It would be a while longer till she figured out where the Keystone really went, that was a wild time.
But for now, she focused back on the fight below where Fourarms was just finished dealing with Vilgax's droid.
She pulled Ben's hoverboard out and flew down to the street.

suddenly remembers about the charm, runs back to try grab it but mage is gone
"I'm sorry, I forgot - I got too excited about winning!

And to continue their journey:		
a walk along the bridge.			
Less a boardwalk, 
more anti-promenade now.

Countless shades, 
drifting along, 
drained in hue,
but painted in dawn.		
 
Above, deep expanse. 				
Placid pool. 
Purple-Thick.
Almost clear, yet strewn with wisps. 	

Even here, their thoughts kept drifting up.
But it wasn't there, nothing was.

????????????????????????????????????????????

Less sky along the skyline though.
						
A word was recalled, 
one taught by travellers,
'Kirbir'.
This self-aggrandised city,
the Ringed City.

Its outline, once of shifted dirt,
sprouted into a tiara, 
then shut as a circlet.
Spires grew, 
and still grow.
They threaten to arch over,
to close the crown, 
and cage it all.

A self-appointed monarch,
adorned with gems,
'bartered' from others.

No wonder it's own jewel was smashed.
No wonder that jewel was shattered and crushed, 
and spread with the wind as dust.

Between the buildings,
fallen day peeked.
Themselves more like gems.
Ruby-Splendour glowed in spots,
bursting with Crimson, 
yet slowly sinking at the speed of night. 		
			
With rationed heat pulled from fading embers, 
bright tendrils s p r e a d from the mass,
reaching far above the city edge, 
cooling into the darkness that was slowly encroaching.
 
Now they reached the quadrangle. 
Massive.
Slightly sunken, 
in fact, 
noticeably lower than the surrounding areas.		

It felt so open, 					
this place did. 
The world above
and around, 
all seemed to expose this spot. 					

As though a show were to commence. 
As though they were to sink below
or immediately be swept up into the sky.	

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 

Night almost in place, 
they finally reached their district.
They walked past an interesting sight: 		
a Magir, apparently at least,
spraying furious energy into the glowing core of a lamp-post.
Their arms held high, with fingers dancing about.	

Sharp strands of Brilliant-Neon shot out from their hands, 
flashing between Blue and Yellow.
The bulb responded with calm breathes, 
dimming softly into darkness, 
before gleaming brightly a different shade,
sometimes two at once.

A small group marvelled at this display, 
as did one of the travelling duo, 
who was quickly ushered forward by the other.

"Come, come now Vani. 
We need to reach the inn before someone takes our room, again. 
You wouldn't want to spend another sleepless night in the park, would you?"

"Ah, no, of course not. 
But...that...was something wonderous. 
Who are those people? 
I've seen a few of them around town."

"Oh, you mean the Order of Electrical Showoffs?"

"Are they Magir?"

"Yes, of a kind. 
They are entertainers, not much more. 
Don't be too enamored with them, 
they haven't much use outside amusing onlookers."

"But they can create it themselves right? Brilliant-Neon?"

"Hmm, yes. They can. 
If they could be willing to do so for research then that would be actually useful. 
However, 
their leader strictly prohibits the participation of members in anything worthwhile, such as empirical research. 
Only entertainment, they pledge."

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

They crossed the eventual street.			
Two stores sat ahead.

One for cloth, 
glowing with a Tangerine-Mellow.			
Dense reams of drapery, 
seen through the front display, 	
echoing their way down, 						
all into the shadowed walls.

And to it's right, 
a puppet shop. 
Same shade as a leaf plucked freshly for tea.
Strewn with wooden dolls along its display.
Though, 
if one squinted past these, 
the rest of the shop would emerge, 
covered in all manner of wonderous marionnettes - 
of every size, every material, every shape, 
and of every level of intricacy that one could possibly imagine. 
Or at least that the creators could.		

A strip of doorway sat open between these two much wider buildings. 	
Demarked with Amber-Thin.
This entry was the inn. 

The hallway in was also rather narrow. And as one pair went in, another were to come out, carrying a bedframe. One of the pair crouched, Vani hoped the two could just step over them. But Pers stood firm only nudging aside slightly, and making the whole experience longer for everyone.

"Hey, are you going to move or what?" said the front carrier, their shoulder balancing an Indigo frame, lacquered and made of bars somewhat fancifully curved to resemble floral shapes.

"Just raise the frame above your heads, and move past me. It's not that difficult."

"Not that difficult!?" the rear frame-carrier yelled, "This frame is made of dulium! Metal bars filled with even more dense metal! This thing weighs more than your ego, so just move aside!"

"Pers, just let them go past." Vani stated, their words apparently being drowned out by the angry voices around them.

As the two and one argued, not much progress being made, firm steps and an angry voice grabbed everyone's notice.

"Stop blocking the entranceway! Out! All of you!" She yelled, sweeping everyone onto the street nearly by sheer will of voice alone.

The four, now outside, looked at each other sheepishly before turning back to the door. Even as a silhouette, the Manager's furious aura burned obvious through Amber-Eyes.

"You two." 

She pointed at the lifters.

"I've sent pay to your company, so that's all I have today." 

She waved vaguely at the large bedframe.

One of the lifters jittered into a curtesy, "Oh, um, th--thank you, Madam. We will be off then." 

And the two hurried off with the frame. Or at least attempted to, struggling to do so with any grace due to the immense weight of the thing. But, eventually, they faded into the shadows down the street.

Turning her attention to the remaining pair, which immediately pulled their focus, the Manager sighed, dropping her shoulders.

"Just, come inside. And try not to cause trouble before you get to the room, Pers."

Pers tucked his lips in, dramatically flipping his coat over his shoulder and striding in. All Vani could do was shake their head, and follow along.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 

Beyond the narrow entranceway, behind the front desk, at the end of the building was the Manager's room. Filled with the warmth, smell and glow of a long-sustained fire, it was almost unreasonably comfortable for such a small space - a single window propped open to keep some semblance of airflow going.

Three pillows were set up in front of the fire, a drinks tray set behind them. The Manager went for her spot - a seemingly well-practiced act that involved snatching a glass and bottle off the tray, yanking out the cork, pouring out a generous amount of liquid and guzzling it down just in time to plop down onto her cushion.

Pers paused at the drinks tray though immediately nudged forward, grumbling lightly and taking a place to the Manager's left with Vani on his left.

Other than the crackling fire, the only other sound in the room was the manager gulping down another large portion of drink.

Vani looked over at their protege, who, expectedly, was staring at the drink like someone was drinking gold.

She finished the glassful with a heavy sigh, lifting the bottle and almost pouring another portion but instead re-closing the bottle.

“So…” she began, turning to eye the two sternly. Her face was mostly obscured with shadows but Amber glinted through easily, “...anything useful?”

“Well, the buns they sell on the southern coast are divine.” Pers replied.

She raised her eyebrow, a clear, deep scowl not budging.

"God be praised?" He added with a shrug.

Vani sighed and spoke up, “We did try but...we, uh, didn’t find anything.” 

“Nothing, huh?” The manager slouched forward, pouring a tiny portion out and quickly sipping it down.

“Anything on your end?” Pers asked.

“Nope.”

Pers glanced back at the drinks tray, “Same as always.” 

????????????????????????????????????????????
?

city is trying to push forward with secular unification, administratively stagnating religious initiatives such as a funded pilgrimage road with attractions, temple repairs, expansion of religious teaching programs or protection of church controlled materials - there are many religiously divisive issues but the statue is seen as the lynchpin, but could not be directly or indirectly targeted by the city

the three all dislike the current state of things but also hold slightly different views on the matter:

- the manager thinks even as sloppily and poorly done the process is, encouraging a moving beyond the statue is necessary since she considers the whole thing superstitution and conflicts based on superstition aren't beneficial - only physical matters are beneficial and the need to orient the city around such is apparent to her

- Pers thinks the enterprise is doomed to fail even though he would prefer the city does try something forward-thinking but also does not see unity as declared by one group as desireable - not particularly bothered if truthes are lost or not

- Vani thinks the truth of the statue matter is out there and that the city is purposefully acting to squash knowledge - also as a religious sort, at least culturally, hates themselves for the fake work they're partaking in in dealing with the statue and that the city is acting anti-religiously but also dislikes the ways that the religious fervour have manifested currently such as with the financial lyings of their council member client

? 
? 
? 
????????????????????????????????????????????

She casually took a small log and tossed it into the fire, “They postponed judgement on the Route again."

"Really don't want anything distracting from their 'little project', huh?" Vani stated.

Their partner chuckled, "Heh, they're going to bury the process in delays. Hope everyone forgets, moves on, and, just like that, new unity."

"We'd be lucky to get councils to agree on meeting times," chimed the Manager.

After taking a few seconds for a sip, she continued, "Well at least they're trying something. We can't keep being stuck on unanswerable questions." 

"But it's not a problem to profit from it?" Vani asked pointedly.

The Manager shrugged, pouring another shot and brushing her lips with the glass edge before lowering it again. "If you mean them, then maybe? They still take taxes and fines and payments without giving the services owed. That's a cheat." 

She danced her cup around, Clear-Liquid shining from Orange-Flames captured within, then looks up at Vani, "If you mean us? Then, yeah." She continued, "For right now? We might as well take advantage of the City's uselessness."

"Somebody's got to." Pers added, with another chuckle at the end. 

The glass raises again, and she floats it in front of her mouth, "Besides, it's only for a little while longer. The winds are changing and soon we'll have to change everything."

Pers and Vani echoed the same words identically, "What do you mean?"

The Manager laughed, she put down the cup and bottle then resettled into a new slouch. "I've heard whisperings of a guild, or something like that, for every profession that can be named."

"What, like in the old days of other places? They want to import that as an idea?" Pers asked.

She shrugged, "You can never know what those ink-stainers are thinking. But, apparently, it would mean that we would have to register. We would have to do 'honest work'," she shook her head, "whatever that means to them. And we would have to pay for 'the honour of being registered'."

"So you would have to reorganise how you budget things." Vani said.

"Everything! This would change everything! Who I contract, who I contact. Where I send my people. Even which side of the bed I sleep on!"

"All because they want a 'clean slate' on which to build unity." Pers said, "If this is true, then they'll have to do big things to organise this. Which means they want to do even bigger things with this in place."

"Creation of a councillor's utopia. Everything orderly and categorised nicely. Easy to represent on two-sided poster, or a twenty page report." The Manager scoffed.

"With everything irrelevant pushed beyond the margins." Vani said harshly, the other two nodding in agreement. 

Pers turned to the Manager at this, "Wait, I thought you wanted them to move forward?"

"They have no talent for organisation! They can't move at all! They will only harm if they start making plans too grand for their clumsy fingers, like a dullard of a farm boy at a drawing board!"

Pers laughed, turning to look at the drinks tray again.

Vani slightly winced at the metaphor, but nodded in agreement all the same. 

"They need to focus on providing what the city needs right now. Not on what the councils feel interested in for the future." She finished, staring at Vani's chest for minute, which they eventually noticed.

Blue-?ak??ma glowed from their front pocket, and they pulled out a pulsating crystal, rough-cut into a shape like a sea-cucumber. 

"Hahhh..." Vani rose, shaking the gem until it silenced, "Time to work." 

"That your pickups start so late now, that feels like a cheat." Pers said. 

"Yes, and the work has been getting drier and drier. Soon they will ask me to carry one sheet of silk and then go home." Their protege responded.

"Perhaps a guild would do you some good." The Manager mused, "Then you would have assured work at consistent times. Or at least proper ones. Are you sure that you work for a real organisation?" She asked with a smirk.

Vani paused at the doorway, "I wonder..." They said, heading off with some last words, mainly pointed at Pers, "Don't drink too much."

"I promise to hold my head up!" He responded, immediately grabbing four bottles and two cups to the amusement of the Manager.

Standing outside in the quiet night, Vani slouched back onto the now shut front door and gazed up.

"Sometimes it feels like all my work now is fake." They softly said.

Clear and calm as ever.
Even the stars could not hide.
So where was it all?
Where does it hide? In what sky?

They stopped their thoughts of above and turned down to the street ahead. They needed to go to the office, get the location and do their job. A lonely walk awaited them.

Thoughts

I'm thinking about making Vani different from 'able-bodied' in some sense. I want to create a sense of 'difference' with them. I mean, yes, they are enby and have a post-colonial mentality, and I will *need* to make that clear in how they see the world. But, also, ever since Eastshade got my hopes up (I thought that because of the character who said of their brother losing a leg/arm that it wasn't the worst since the brother lived as opposed to treating it like the worst possible fate, worse than death which is part of ableism, and also the presence in the first small town of the ramp next to the stairs - I figured it was accessibility in action) and then dashed them (the game has a couple of wheelchaired characters who are prominently defined by feelings of lost potential and being trapped - which if it was a statement about the disabling nature of society would be one thing, but no, it's just a statement that disability status sucks and is only downsides - you're not different, the game says, you're just worse) of being set in a world that is specifically anti-ableist. 

So I wanna make this world anti-ablist, but partly in a govt self-motivated sense and also the reflected reaction to the pretend concern - like a sort of greenwashing equivalent of inclusivity vs the feelings of those who aren't included? 

Nahh, I do want genuine inclusion and a character that feels *great* regardless of how their body might be perceived by folk in our world. 

Maybe, the govt pretending but also it tapping into long held beliefs of inclusivity, held back by imperialistic ideals of what to focus on. 

I dunno - I want the idea of inclusivity being an outcome of the govt trying to cynically bring people together, but also I want a society that is anti-ableist and the two are very hard to blend.

And I don't just want these ideas expressed through a side character (maybe I could make several characters have disabilities? and maybe use a different term in my story, I dunno, I think in a world where its acceptable the term 'disabled' would be perceived as too emphatic on what someone has lost rather than what they have...

Getting lost sucks.
Especially at night.
And especially in a freaky, bamboo forest. 
The sprinkled moonlight turns everything into a maze of black lines in a mushy, dark green haze. It was quiet too, the perfect setting for the Creeping Terror to show up and attack. Plus, it was kinda cold. 
Getting back to Uncle Jackie was gonna be rough.
All that's what made the temple that popped out of nowhere so inviting, even with its creepy Fu dogs out front. Doors and stairs all over the place. Every wall leaned and was filled with slanted openings. An archway turned this away, a window twisted that away. With all its different levels like this, it looked like a cake layered crooked.
So it wasn't any surprise that Jade sped right up. 
And it was way less surprising that she found trouble immediately.
That girl in green - shaking, crying, sitting alone - was a clear point of interest. Obvious candidate for help, and her low crying quickly drew Jade inside. 
But that was a mistake.  
The crying paused with a confused 'Oh?'
She turned, showing a weary, tear-soaked face. Large eyes, like the size of those really big marbles, stared in disbelief, "You should not be in here..."
But those kind of words only encourage the young Chan, who pulled even closer, "Why? What's the matter? Why are you crying?"
Then those massive eyes shrank to pinheads as a desperate plea was let out, "Run from this place! Please!" 
She grabbed her head, closed her eyes, and braced for something awful. And as Jade instanly found out, that 'something awful' was the huge, monstrous beast-form that the girl turned into, eager to get claws and teeth into the unexpected guest.
?????????????????????????????????
They chased and chased around the entire temple, tough act for the one who didn't live in the place. Running up and down stairs, hiding past old doors, and digging through piles of junk, Jade used everything to stall. At last, after minutes of running, she finally found herself back on the main hall. She went straight for the exit but then the creature mouth-sprayed ice at her feet, and she slipped. Sliding on her back dumped her right outside the doorway, leaving her an easy target for the approaching fur-demon. She gasped but was surprised as the creature's face slammed into some invisible wall. Bright flashes with what sounded like some serious electricity zapped the creature limp until they fell flat backwards. The huge creature faded, leaving the small girl once again.
For a second or two, she groaned before getting up into an apologetic bow, "I humbly, *huff* *huff*, beg forgiveness," she gasped out.
Jade stayed grounded, "Uhhh, okay, what the heck was all that about?!"
Streams began flowing down her face again, "I can't, please, just leave. You only risk your life by coming in here. I am sorry." 
There was more, she wanted to say more, Jade could tell. 
"Hey, listen, you ain't gotta be scared. See, me and my Uncle Jackie, we've dealt with all kinds of messed up magic. We're like the Ghostbusters of bad chi, ya feel me? Sooo..." Jade paused slightly, watching the girl for a second, "...any trouble you've got, we can help!"
The temple girl sniffled, looking aside rather than face-on.
"No. I cannot risk your lives. Please, leave." And she walked away, ignoring the loud calls from behind.
Clearly, this was bad. Jade bounced on her feet, looking around, and not seeing anybody.
"Errr, uhh, what do I do? What do I do?" 
Down the hall, soft footsteps faded away, leaving the silent night again. 
Suddenly, Jade's eyes widened, "Oh! Got it!"
Entering the temple again, she stood right by the doorway and waited for the not-so-Creeping Terror to gallop from around the corner. Then, jumping back out, she left the creature to slam face first into whatever magical wall was holding them inside.
And once again, they reverted to the girl. 
This time, she remained on her knees, "Why? Why do you mock me?!"
Her hands balled as she bent over to the floor, more reluctant tears emerging.
Jade waved her hands frantically, "No no no! I'm not mocking you! I want t help you! You're trapped here aren't you?"
Pushing herself to her feet, the girl screamed, "Go away and leave me alone!!"
Well Jade yelled back, "No! Not until you let me help you!"
"Gahh! You cannot help me! How can you not understand?! You do not know what this place is, what magic resides here! You know nothing! You are a fool! Your efforts will be worthless and in the end, like all the others, you shal--!"
Her hand quickly covered her mouth, desperately muffled pained cries as she sank back onto her knees.
Slowly, Jade crouched to one knee. Her hands reached out but then stopped short, hovering right before the threshold.
"Look. One time, my Uncle Jackie, he got hit with some bad juju. It, it made him start going full gargoyle...he was turning into a statue." She turned her head down for a moment before lifting it again to continue, "Uncle-- Oh. Uhh. Different uncle - did everything he could to try and reverse it, but it didn't work. Nothing worked. We didn't know what to do. We were searching for a local number in an international phone book."
Her voice quivered at the end, and she almost broke out laughing at how emotional she was getting over this. "As time went on, more and more of his body turned into a garden decoration, and...it felt like...there was nothing we could do. Ya know, other than clear out a spot in the park for him. I thought...I'd lose him...forever."
The girl looked up at the last part, after being mumbled half-lifelessly. Jade paused, and was now the one studying the floor. 
"And, well, he turned. Completely. Seemed like that was it. My uncle, the statue." A giggled slipped through, as did a couple of tears that dotted her jeans. "But. It turned out we had the answer all along! A magical talisman that cured him!"
She finally looked back up, staring into her counterpart's eyes. "What I'm saying is... It might seem rough. It might feel like there's no way anything good could come anymore." Jade lifted a sleeve to wipe off her eyes. "But magi--Life! It's always got a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card for ya. We can beat this, whatever this funky temple is!"
A determined face smirked at the temple girl, fist raised with eyes searching deep for a similar feeling on the other side. Ten seconds passed. Silent staring, with a bit of sniffling here and there. But, finally:
"You talk...very freely, and flippantly."
Jade tilted her head at that last word.
"Even so, if you would dare curse yourself... I suppose... I can allow you to try."
A fist-pump signalled a fired-up Chan, "Yes! I just know we can do it if we try!"
This pulled a disappointed frown from the girl, still with wet cheeks.  
"Just do not become too complacent"  
"Again with the big words. You must read a lot, uhhh...hey, what's your name anyway?"
The temple girl stood up, wiping her face with a sleeve this time but with her frown frozen in place, "I am Xiu Lin."
